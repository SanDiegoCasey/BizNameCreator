Please provide your own key from domainr.build/ and markerapi.com to recreate.

This app is using three different APIs.

The uzby.com name generation API is used to create random pronounceable words that can be used
as business names at whatever length the user wants.

Then the domainr.com api is used to check against the 4 top web extensions to see if they are already
taken and provide the user the opportunity to purchase directly from the app.  If the domain is taken it gives you the opportunity to quickly go to it and check it out. 

Then the markerapi.com is used to query the current trademark status to see if there are any LIVE listings for this word, if not it gives you the opportunity to go directly to the USPTO.gov site to register.

This app utilized; HTML, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY, JSON, CSS

The APIS were called using plain AJAX requests and also a getJSON request.
