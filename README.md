This app is using two different apis.

The uzby.com name generation API is used to create random pronouncable words that can be used
as business names at whatever length the user wants. 

Then I use the domainr api to check against the 4 top web extensions to see if they are already 
taken and provide the user the oppertunity to purchase directly from the app. 

This app utilized; HTML, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY, JSON, CSS 

The APIS were called using an XMLHttpRequest (ActiveXObject for older browsers) and a getJSON request.
