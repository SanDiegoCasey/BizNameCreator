Currently at biznamecreator.com 

This app is using two different apis.

The uzby.com name generation API is used to create business names at specific lengths. 

Then I use the domainr api to check against the 4 top web extensions to see if they are already 
taken and provide the user the oppertunity to purchase directly from the app. 

This app utilized; HTML, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY, JSON, CSS 

The APIS were called using an XMLHttpRequest (ActiveXObject for older browsers) and a getJSON request.
